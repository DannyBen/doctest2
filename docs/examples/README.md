# Examples

You can [download the examples folder](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/DannyBen/jobly/tree/master/examples)

Each folder contains annotated example files and a README with further explanations or commands to try out.

It is recommended that you view the [01-minimal](01-minimal.md) and [02-full](02-full.md) examples first, before continuing to the topical examples.
